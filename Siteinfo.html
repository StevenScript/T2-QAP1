              Roughly 2-5 hours a day, across 7-8 days. Although that may not be representative of difficulty, as I am slow when deciding on designs and ideas.
              The hardest part with time management was where I misjudged how difficult it would be to incorporate my recently acquired figma knowledge. I was also unaware how much I had forgotten and need to practice.

              I used primarily lecture knowledge, reviewing my past assignments I had done for different types of sites, asking ChatGPT to tutor and walk me through each part I was unfamiliar with. I had forgotten that you have your code on GitHub until Thursday, too late to apply it to my learning before finishing the site.
              I like to read and pick at code to learn it, so in the future I will be using your GitHub code a lot more as an integral part of my learning.

              Nope! But on the contrary, I have shared advice on how to find CC-friendly content or websites to use to help. But no direct discussion, asking, or sharing on the website or the code.

              No, but as mentioned, I needed ChatGPT to walk me step by step through a lot to warm up. As I made each page, I used GPT less and less for help. This page was made with almost any help, just pasting previous code from other pages and modifying what I want, or in the case of these boxes, I would add something new.

            <p>5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of making this all from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.</p>

              It was hard for me to start, as I felt my end goal was too vague, but only due to it feeling too simple and undefined to be correct in my understanding of it.
              After seeing so many new things and wanting to try new ideas, I overextended myself.
              If I had my time back and done the website completely from scratch, with also having access to your GitHub for knowledge of where I should be with my code, I would have made a much more fluid site with more content. As there are many things I decided were too outside of the scope and too lengthy to try to learn and add into this.
              To summarize, the difficulty was of my own creation. Doing this made me remember my skills, and now I'd have an easy time building my own site.
